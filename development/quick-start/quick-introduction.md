Magic's enterprise internal chat feature supports multiple users online simultaneously, with a clean and intuitive interface similar to WeChat, making it easy for employees to use. Whether it's one-on-one private communication or group discussions with multiple participants, conversations can be initiated instantly.

In terms of group management, it has powerful permission settings that allow administrators to flexibly assign different member permissions, such as:
