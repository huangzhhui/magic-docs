## Balancing Business and Open-Source Sustainability

We will open-source almost everything! In the coming time, we will adopt a **"progressive open-source"** strategy. However, separating numerous systems and features from existing businesses and implementing open-source still requires an enormous amount of work. As a startup company with limited funds and personnel, we need to seek a balance between business and open-source sustainability, ensuring sufficient funds to continue operations, thereby guaranteeing that the project can be continuously maintained and iterated.

Therefore, we provide [SaaS cloud services](https://www.letsmagic.cn) for [Super Magic](https://www.letsmagic.cn), [Magic IM](https://www.letsmagic.cn/chat), and [Magic Flow](https://www.letsmagic.cn/flow), allowing anyone to quickly start using them with all the features of the open-source version.
*Note: Currently, an invitation code is still required to use the service, which can be applied for online. Once approved, you can try it online.*

In addition, SaaS paying users and enterprise-version private deployment customers will be able to experience our latest features with priority.

## Who Is Suitable for Using Magic

We believe that the following three types of roles are very suitable for using Magic:

### **Working Professionals: Become a Super Individual**

Super Magic's general-purpose Agent mode can help you become a super individual with 100x productivity. You can manage countless digital versions of yourself to help you break down and execute complex tasks in the cloud without occupying your time. It will display work progress in real-time, giving you absolute control. You can use Super Magic to free yourself from complicated affairs, end your workplace pressure, and focus on work that truly creates value!

### **Entrepreneurs and Managers: Establish Super Organizations, Achieve Extraordinary Business**

If you are an entrepreneur, manager, or aspire to become one, Super Magic is your best testing ground. You can use it to construct another digital team, transforming your role from executor to strategic planner, from process follower to innovation leader. You can take on more challenging projects, take on greater responsibilities, and achieve higher accomplishments.

Super Magic will greatly enhance your team's collaboration capabilities. You can rapidly prototype team ideas and quickly transform meeting decisions into visualized results. Your team will no longer be trapped in repetitive collaboration; everyone can focus on creative collisions and efficient communication. Super Magic will become the shared brain of the team, transforming collaboration from linear development to exponential growth, giving small teams the execution power of large organizations.

![](https://cdn.letsmagic.cn/static/img/magic-admin-data-analyse.png)

The data analysis section provided by the Magic management backend is not just a tool for displaying AI usage, but also a strategic guide for organizational transformation. It helps you identify key resistance points in the organizational upgrade process by visually displaying differences in AI acceptance across departments and team members, technical adaptation bottlenecks, and business process transformation obstacles. You can clearly see which departments have not yet embraced AI, which business processes are encountering difficulties in transformation, and which key position personnel need additional support. The system intelligently analyzes efficiency change curves of various office modules (such as OA approval, to-do lists, project management, etc.) during AI-ization, revealing stagnation points and breakthroughs in the transformation process, allowing you to formulate targeted intervention strategies. These insights will help your organization truly complete the comprehensive upgrade from technology introduction to organizational culture reshaping, ensuring that AI is not just a superficial technology application, but a productivity transformation tool deeply embedded in the organization's DNA.

## Magic's Three Modes

Super Magic offers three different AI implementation modes to meet different needs in different scenarios:

**Agent Mode**: Corresponding to Super Magic, providing medium certainty and high intelligence, suitable for exploratory tasks and creative work. In this mode, AI agents can autonomously think, reason, make decisions, and act, handling complex and open-ended problems for users, such as market research, content creation, strategic planning, and data analysis.

**Workflow Mode**: Corresponding to Magic Flow, providing high certainty and medium intelligence, suitable for structured business processes and repetitive tasks. In this mode, the system executes tasks according to preset workflows while retaining enough intelligence to handle variables and exceptions in the process, particularly suitable for approval processes, data processing, and standardized processes.

**AI Micro APP Mode**: This is a mode we will iteratively release next, providing absolute certainty, combined with a high degree of product interaction experience and personalized customization, as well as flexible levels of intelligence. This mode fully utilizes the increasingly powerful programming capabilities of current large models, allowing users to create specialized applications for specific business scenarios, ensuring accuracy and reliability in critical business processes while maintaining a good user experience.

![Image](https://cdn.letsmagic.cn/static/img/super-magic-modes.png)

The existence of these modes ensures that Magic can maximize value in both "non-serious business scenarios" and "serious business scenarios," **being both low-threshold and high-ceiling**, while also producing magical effects through combined use of multiple modes.

## Closing Remarks

Before the AI revolution swept in, China's enterprise-level SaaS market had already formed a "tripartite" situation centered around Feishu, DingTalk, and WeChat Work. These three major products, with the resource advantages of tech giants behind them, built a suffocating all-round product matrix, covering almost all core scenarios of enterprise digitalization:

Starting from the most basic instant messaging (IM), these platforms gradually expanded to the office collaboration domain, launching a series of knowledge management tools such as Feishu Cloud Documents, DingTalk Documents, Feishu Multi-dimensional Tables, DingTalk Multi-dimensional Tables, and WeChat Work Smart Tables. As business scenarios deepened, they also deployed low-code platforms, such as Feishu Low-code Platform and DingTalk Yida, and achieved connection with existing enterprise systems through connectors (Feishu Connector, DingTalk Connection Platform).

This comprehensive coverage strategy has compressed the survival space of almost all other SaaS startups. With the strong capital strength and user base of their parent companies, they often adopt free strategies to seize the market and then harvest the market after dragging down competitors, making it difficult for many startups focused on a single domain to cope. Users, while temporarily enjoying free services, have unwittingly fallen into the dilemma of data islands and ecosystem lock-in.

Users generally face several pain points when using these giant products: first, data is locked in closed ecosystems, making it difficult to migrate; second, customization needs cannot be met, forcing passive acceptance of standardized services; third, pricing power is completely in the hands of the platform, which may face price increases at any time; fourth, data security and privacy protection are worrying.

In addition, in the AI era, enterprise control over its core data is particularly important, and in many enterprises, a large amount of business occurs in "chat," which is the most valuable "corpus" of this era.

For a long time in the past, we as users had no choice but to accept forcibly, choosing reluctantly from a limited number of options. Solutions that truly meet business personalization needs almost did not exist, while business requires corresponding flexibility.

However, our developed Magic product matrix, with full-domain self-development and commercialized open-source model, provides new possibilities for users and businesses.

Under the commercialized open-source model, the openness of source code is essentially a dispersion of power. Users will have the right to exit; when users are dissatisfied, they can export data and deploy the open-source version for self-use. This "can leave at any time" option forces us to continuously polish products and create new continuous value rather than hold users hostage through lock-in effects.

Moreover, our team has deeply cultivated in real business scenarios across multiple industries. This background gives us values and working methods drastically different from internet giants. We better understand where users' pain points are because we have personally experienced the pain of being "hijacked" by giant products, deeply knowing the real needs and pain points of enterprise users. We are more pragmatic; unlike internet culture that pursues user growth and valuation, we are more concerned about whether the product truly solves users' problems, and we also hope this pragmatic gene can penetrate deeply into the team's DNA.

**In summary, open-source is not only a discipline for us but also a promise we make to our users.**
